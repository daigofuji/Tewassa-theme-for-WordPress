Bones is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It was updated recently
using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup.

This is the responsive version and uses a lot of the latest "best practices" 
for designing responsive sites. It uses the "Mobile First" approach 
so that the smallest screens always get the lightest load.
